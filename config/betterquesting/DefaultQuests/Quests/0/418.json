I was right to expect some sort of contingency plan from the Shyre Empire.\nThe powers of this being, this creature that so closely resembles an Old One while being nothing like one, have something to do with time. Not the mere entropy manipulation that allows me to speed things up locally. No, actual time manipulation.\nI do not know how long I have been in this place, how long my fight with this creature truly took. It felt like mere moments, but after hearing the chant, after understanding the words, I know I may come back to a very different Terra, one that may have endured for long after my time, or one that may have given up.",
